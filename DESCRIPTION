Description: This package implement the clustering algorithm described by Alex
    Rodriguez and Alessandro Laio (Science, 2014 vol. 344), along with tools to
    inspect and visualize the results. The data input for the algorithm is a
    distance matrix so the user is free to define arbitrary distance measures
    that fits their data, or uses the dist() function provided by the stats
    package.
